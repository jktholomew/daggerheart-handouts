# daggerheart-handouts
handouts for Players and GM for the Daggerheart TTRPG

This project has two sections, (a) the Player handout, meant to help players at the table quickly reference gameplay basics, and (b) the GM Screen, made to quickly reference useful rules in the SRD.

None of the written work of this project is my own. All written work is taken from the Daggerheart SRD.

If you'd like to use this for your own work, just ask me on Reddit /u/daddyLongHairs
